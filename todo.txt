Adjacent MSR vessels with same filter form bundle to share flux, shared criticality factor is sum of single vessel criticality factors

Take number of available open faces of vessel bundle into account when calculating the heat multiplier (and efficiency)
(actual heat multiplier) = 6*(number of vessels)*(raw heat multiplier)/(number of open faces)
(number of open faces = number of faces not adjacent to another vessel of the same bundle)

Required neutron sources to prime vessel bundle = (number of open faces)/6

Girdler process for deuterium extraction: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girdler_sulfide_process
Add generic reaction tower for slow chemical recipes

Girdler process requires two towers:
H2S + [preheated water OR steam?] + energy -> deuterium-enriched H2S + deuterium-depleted water
deuterium-enriched H2S + water -> H2S + deuterium-enriched water

Fractional distillation: deuterium-enriched water -> heavy water + water
